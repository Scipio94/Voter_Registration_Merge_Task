## Description

Determine whether or not mailing a voter a paper copy of their registration form increases the likelihood of that they'll register to vote and then vote in the election.The ideal test of mailings’ effect would be a randomized controlled trial: picking a partner, likely a college campus, where we could offer mailings to some students and not to others. There is a database with the few hundreds of thousands of college-aged voters.

For these users we have the following information:

- Name 
- Address
- DOB
- Whether or not they requested a copy of the registration form
- The date they signed up for the database
- A confidence-rating that their information matches voter registration record



## Objective

Provide a methodology to analyze the impact of mailed forms have on successful voter registrations and turnout.

## Methodology

To guage the effectiveness of a specific portion of the college campus, I'd only analyze the impact of the mailed voter registration form on the full-time on campus students. Prior to sending out the voter registration forms, I’d collect data on the number of full time on-campus registered voters in each dormitory. Then, after the forms have been mailed out and prior to the election I’d collect data on voter registration of full-time on-campus students and take note of any change in the voter registration data, whether or not there is a positive or negative correlation of voter registration. I'd set various drop boxes across campus to collect voter registration forms. Additionally, I'd also have reminderd about the upcoming election.
